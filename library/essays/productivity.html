    <p>Thoughts on productivity written by Jet Williams on Jan 11th, 2024</p>

    <hr />

    <p>
      I wrote this list as a basic framework to help increase the productivity
      in my life. These principles are merely guidelines and the opposite of
      each idea is almost also true in some cases.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Eat the frog first</li>
      <li>Accept that everything is a work in progress</li>
      <li>Get going then get good</li>
      <li>Brick by brick</li>
      <li>Laugh at perfection</li>
      <li>Finished work creates more finished work</li>
      <li>Fail more but learn from your mistakes</li>
      <li>Write to organise your thoughts and ideas</li>
      <li>Allocate time dedicated to thinking about ideas</li>
      <li>Curate your content consumtion using RSS feeds</li>
      <li>Write lots of lists</li>
      <li>Use a text to speech generator to test how your writing reads</li>
      <li>If you get an idea write it down immediately</li>
      <li>Start what you finish but also know when to quit</li>
    </ul>
