    <h1>May 25 2024 - The Five</h1>

    <p>
      I just finished reading Kevin Kelly’s book excellent advice for living in
      almost one sitting. The book is filled with over 400 short maxims and
      advice on life.
    </p>

    <p>
      Kevin was the person who originally inspired me to write
      <a href="/library/blog/principles.html">my own principles</a>
      for life list. My list contains 30 principles which I think all have
      genuine value.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, after reading Kevin’s book I feel inspired to try simplify that
      list into 5 core values.
    </p>

    <p>So here’s my five,</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Eat your vegetables</li>
      <li>Follow your heart</li>
      <li>Learn to wait</li>
      <li>Always be learning</li>
      <li>Trust</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      On a side note, I’ve really been enjoying writing. The medium itself is so
      simple and it’s a great way for me to find clarity by piecing my thoughts
      together.
    </p>

    <p>
      I also submitted an artwork I created to
      <a href="https://seize.io">The Memes</a> collection by 6529 this morning.
      I hope I get a reply from the team.
    </p>
