    <h1>First Principles</h1>
    <h4>May 26th, 2024</h4>

    <p>
      I heard the term <strong>first principles</strong> get thrown around
      multiple times this week. It wasn’t until I listened to Tim Urban break
      down exactly what that meant
      <a
        href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/78n0InNmjIQoWnfqZDGmun?si=16e59f5b05904bfd"
        >on the Lex Fridman show</a
      >, that I understood what all these people had been talking about.
    </p>

    <p>
      This shift from analogy to first principle thinking is a great way to
      explore uncharted territories by ignoring so called convention. Most
      people in business, art or whatever field they are in are generally just
      copying the industry leaders.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here’s a great example I found
      <a href="https://fs.blog/first-principles/">here</a> explaining the
      difference between analogy and principle first thinking.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      The difference between reasoning by first principles and reasoning by
      analogy is like the difference between being a chef and being a cook. If
      the cook lost the recipe, he’d be screwed. The chef, on the other hand,
      understands the flavor profiles and combinations at such a fundamental
      level that he doesn’t even use a recipe. He has real knowledge as opposed
      to know-how.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      From what I understand there’s usually a few trailblazers in each industry
      that don’t follow the rules but create them.
    </p>

    <p>
      Usually after they find success there’s hundreds of copycats who try to
      emulate their approach. Yet what the copycats don’t understand is why the
      original approach worked in the first place.
    </p>

    <p>
      These trailblazers broke whatever problem down into its most core
      principles and made their own judgment. They didn’t listen to a YouTube
      video that told them what was right, they ignored the consensus and formed
      their own conclusion.
    </p>

    <p>
      Critical thinking in the age of AI has been on my mind for the past year.
      Understanding biases and what influences our decision making is something
      that really fascinates me.
    </p>

    <p>
      I plan on doing more research into first principles reasoning and how to
      come to your own conclusions.
    </p>

    <p>
      It’s exciting to think that the coolest inventions of the next 50 years
      have yet to be made.
