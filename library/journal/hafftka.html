    <h1>May 24 2024 - The Great Hafftka</h1>

    <p>
      I’m thankful that I’ve woken up another day and get to create. I have a
      podcast episode scheduled to record in 30 minutes with the artist
      <a href="https://hafftka.com">Michael Hafftka</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m very excited to chat with someone like Hafftka who’s managed to
      continue to create art well into his seventies.
    </p>

    <p>
      Seeing Hafftka’s work gives me hope for a future of creation. What a
      privilege it must be to continue expressing yourself into your old age.
    </p>

    <p>
      I also found it quite cute that his wife Yonat helped schedule our meeting
      for today. As she acts as the liaison for his inbound requests, so he can
      focus his energy on his art.
    </p>

    <p>I’m still in bed and need to get up and shower before our call.</p>

    <p>
      I woke up at 4am this morning and wrote a blog post about the
      <a href="/library/blog/ask.html">power of just asking</a>, before falling
      back asleep and waking up at 8am.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’ll update this entry after my call with Hafftka and let you know how it
      goes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Alright, I’m back and all I have to say is
      <strong>let's fucking go</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      I really valued what Michael had to say during our conversation and it was
      a great reminder to be a little less hard on myself.
    </p>

    <p>
      For the rest of today I plan on finishing a 1/1 hoodie I’ve been working
      on - which originally started as a sticker I traded at Sneakercon in
      Sydney last week.
    </p>

    <p>
      Full video on that experience and process of remixing the hoodie, coming
      soon.
    </p>
