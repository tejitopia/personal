    <h1>Be lazy, do more</h1>
    <h4>June 17th, 2024</h4>

    <p>
      Laziness is a trait most people frown upon. But it’s beginning to dawn on
      me that laziness can ironically help you get more done.
    </p>

    <p>
      For the past year my desktop has been filthy and it wasn’t until tonight
      that I finally learnt that I could create an automated desktop cleaning
      tool using python in less than an hour.
    </p>

    <p>
      I was too lazy to clean and organise my desktop so I just taught myself
      how to automate it.
    </p>

    <p>
      I can’t remember where I heard it but I vividly remember a sentence along
      the lines of ‘the best business people are the laziest’ and I finally get
      what they meant by that.
    </p>

    <p>
      You only have so much time in a day to allocate to certain tasks and I’d
      personally rather be learning or making something during my free time. So
      it makes sense that I should try automate in my life where necessary.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm excited to look more into python automations along with continue my
      journey learning linux on my new raspberry pi and experimenting with
      electronics on my arduino.
