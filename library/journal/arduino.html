    <h1>Arduino</h1>
    <h4>June 11th, 2024</h4>

    <p>
      Today I purchased an Arduino starter kit so I could begin learning how to
      create and program small electronic devices.
    </p>

    <p>
      I managed to create my first basic circuit using a led light and switch.
      Playing with all the little components that came with the kit reminded me
      of when I was a very young child when I used to take apart cameras and
      radios with my dad’s screwdrivers.
    </p>

    <p>
      I don’t know why I find hacking and building things so fascinating but
      today brought me so much pleasure.
    </p>

    <p>
      I also purchased my first Raspberry Pi which I’m expecting to receive next
      week. I’m really excited to continue completing the Arduino tutorials and
      begin building things with my pi.
    </p>

    <p>
      AI tools like ChatGPT have opened an entire world previously inaccessible
      to myself. I can now code and bring my ideas to reality and that makes me
      extremely excited for the future.
