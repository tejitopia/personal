    <h2>About The Album</h2>

    <p>
      Internet Kid is me teaching myself how to produce music. Until now I've
      never known how to produce my own songs. Starting out I had no idea what I
      was doing inside FL Studio. Until thankfully my brother gave me a hands on
      tutorial to figure out the basics.
    </p>

    <p>
      All the songs on the album were made in a span of my first 2 weeks using
      FL Studio. I was obbsessed. Finally being able to bring the sounds I
      wanted to hear to life felt like magic. The album itself took huge
      inspiration from my experiances on the interent as a kid growing up in the
      early 2000s.
    </p>

    <h2>CC0</h2>

    <p>
      INTERNET KID is CC0 which means the entire album is in the public domain.
      You are permitted to use the songs in anyway you would like. My reasoning
      for open-sourcing my work is because there is no way I could create what I
      create without the help of thousands of creators online who share free
      resources and tutorials with the world. Internet Kid is a thank you note
      to the internet, so it's only right if I give back to the community that
      formed me into who I am today.
    </p>

    <h2>REMIX ME</h2>

    <p>
      I encourage you to repurpose and remix the songs and share your creations
      with the world. If you'd like to learn more about my thoughts on remix
      culture check out
