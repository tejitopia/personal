<h2>About The Album</h2>

<p>Internet Kid is me teaching myself how to produce music. Until now I've never known how to produce my own songs. Starting out I had no idea what I was doing inside FL Studio. Until thankfully my brother gave me a hands on tutorial to figure out the basics.</p>

<p>All the songs on the album were made in a span of my first 2 weeks using FL Studio. I was obbsessed. Finally being able to bring the sounds I wanted to hear to life felt like magic. The album itself took huge inspiration from my experiances on the interent as a kid growing up in the early 2000s.</p>

<h2>CC0</h2>

<p>INTERNET KID is CC0 which means the entire album is in the public domain. You are permitted to use the songs in anyway you would like. My reasoning for open-sourcing my work is because there is no way I could create what I create 
    without the help of thousands of creators online who share free resources and tutorials with the world. Internet Kid is a thank you note to the internet, so it's only right if I give back to the community that formed me into who I am today.</p>

<h2>REMIX ME</h2>

<p>I encourage you to repurpose and remix the songs and share your creations with the world. If you'd like to learn more about my thoughts on remix culture check out <a href="https://blog.teji.io/valuechain">this article</a>.</p>
