    <h1>Letter to Ye on The Power of The Blockchain</h1>

    <p>Hey Ye,</p>

    <p>
      I saw on Instagram you were thinking of excluding Vultures 2 from all
      streaming platforms and only having it available for $20 on yeezy.com.
    </p>

    <p>
      I noticed you mentioned that if you can get 5% of your followers to
      purchase a copy of the album it would equate to 1 million albums sold
      which according to you is '300k more units than the biggest album last
      year'.
    </p>

    <p>
      After selling 1 million items through your store after your viral low
      budget Superbowl ad. You'd think this would be an easy feat.
    </p>

    <p>
      Yet, I've noticed shortly after the announcement the community beginning
      to complain about the possible exclusion from streaming platforms.
    </p>

    <p>
      People weren't happy about the idea of having to pay $20 to listen to
      'some music'. Yet they were more than happy to purchase your clothes weeks
      prior when they were all marked at $20.
    </p>

    <p>
      It's sad that we as a society have been so influenced by streaming
      platforms that we've completely devalued music and online media.
    </p>

    <p>
      If it isn't for free or close to it, it's considered a waste of money. Yet
      I'd argue the time and effort that goes into crafting an entire album
      exceeds that of any clothing item.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some of your favourite songs stay with you for life, while most of the
      shirts we buy end up rotting away in the bottom of our drawers.
    </p>

    <p>
      So why is it so hard for us as a society to wrap our heads around digital
      ownership?
    </p>

    <p>
      Until NFTs came around owning and trading digital assets was practically
      impossible. If you bought a digital album before all you could do was
      download your songs and maybe put them on a hard drive or share them with
      your friends.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, thanks to the blockchain you can now create digital scarcity and
      drive royalties for life back to the wallet of the token creator. You can
      now have a direct relationship with your audience and keep track of who
      owns what tokens.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before the blockchain came along there was really no use for the consumer
      to download a digital copy of your album apart from wanting to directly
      support you.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, if you were to put Vultures 2 onchain you could allow for the
      trading and selling of your music freely on the internet, while you get a
      percent of every secondary sale for life since everything is
      interconnected via the blockchain.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you wanted you could reward all of the owners of the $20 album with VIP
      tickets or discount codes for Yeezy.com. Everything is traceable through
      the blockchain and there are an infinite amount of possibilities for your
      music online.
    </p>

    <p>
      You could build token gated stem players that only allow users to play the
      songs they own. You would give the power back to the people to own what
      they truely love. All those songs we bought on iTunes forever gone simply
      because of a policy change is a reality that could never exist on the
      blockchain.
    </p>

    <p>
      As you know ownership is power and as a consumer today we have none of it.
      By allowing your fans to truely collect your music you will open the
      floodgates to millions of other independent artists to follow your charge.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now that you're independent this is the best way to build deeper
      relationships with your fans online while making sure you're getting paid
      what's right.
    </p>

    <p>
      I don't want anything from you and I doubt you will even see this open
      letter. But in the odd chance you do all I ask is for you to do is look
      into blockchain technology and begin thinking about how you can integrate
      it into your work.
    </p>

    <p>Thanks</p>

    <p>Jet Williams</p>
