    <h1>Why I Love This $44 Watch</h1>

    <p>
    The Casio W800H-1 has become my all time favourite watch. It’s affordable, durable and does what it needs to do. 
    </p>

    <p>
    I’ve had an Apple Watch in the past and even a couple fitness trackers like the Garmin yet I keep coming back to this humble $44 timepiece. 
    </p>

    <h2>But Why?</h2>
    <p>
    First of all I love how non-flashy and discreet it is. The watches utilitarian design makes it the ultimate day to day watch for people who just want something to tell the time with.
    </p>

    <p>
    The first time I saw the watch was on my Dad well over 10 years ago. Ironically the watch encapsulates all of his greatest qualities. It’s quiet, hard working, never complains and gets the job done. 
    </p>

    <p>
    The timeless design paired with its 10 year battery life makes it wearable for the next 10 years. There’s none of this charging before bed bullshit like those annoying smart watches. This thing is an ultra marathon runner that will go the distance. 
    </p>

    <p>
    The watch has this dorky aura which no one in their right mind would ever want to steal. Yet if on the odd occasion someone did want to steal it, I’d happily give it away and buy another one the next day for $44. 
    </p>

    <p>
    There’s no pressure with this watch. It’s not like those expensive designer watches that you’re too scared to even wear out because they might get scratched. It’s easy, it’s simple and does everything a watch should do. Tell the time, let me use the stop watch and set an alarm. 
    </p>

    <p>
    Also <strong>this is not an ad</strong>. I’ve been in no way asked to write this or have been paid by anyone to promote this watch. I’m even purposely not using affiliate links. It’s just a product I genuinely love and want to share its value with people
