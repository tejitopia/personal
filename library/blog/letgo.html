    <h1>Letting Go</h1>

    <h4>Jan 11th, 2024</h4>

    <p>
      The Universe is a funny place. It often feels like everything you want you
      can’t have. It’s this desperation and neediness for things to work out
      that often repels the desired outcome far away from you.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’ve experienced this first hand in my life when it comes to becoming a
      full time creator. I dropped everything to focus on my passion and build
      things online. Yet when the neediness for things to work came in as
      financial pressures began to grow — I started catering my ideas to the
      algorithm and what I should make instead of what I wanted to make.
    </p>

    <p>
      It’s the age old conundrum where the musician who started off making songs
      in their bedroom signs a record deal and is now expected to start putting
      out an album each and every year. As time goes on they lose motivation as
      the label pushes for certain kinds of songs to be made over the
      experimental works that got them to where they are in the first place.
    </p>

    <p>
      In some ways it feels like we are abusing our creativity when we look to
      profit from it. I'm in no way saying you’re not allowed to make money from
      your art — but I am thinking we may need to become more mindful of how we
      treat our creativity.
    </p>

    <p>
      Perhaps instead of needing our creativity to work we just let go and allow
      it to work. It’s something I’ve been working on that has been extremely
      hard for myself. I’ve decided go against all advice from the online gurus
      who tell you to ‘burn the boats’ and ‘go all in’ if you want it to work in
      favour of now going out and looking for a job that will provide enough
      stability to reduce the amount of pressure I’m putting on my creativity.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m a strong believer in the <strong>law of detachment</strong> which is a
      belief that
      <strong
        >you can have anything you want as long as you don't need it</strong
      >. I’ve found this principle to apply to all areas of life —
      <strong>neediness repels and abundance attracts</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Today I let go of all pressures I’ve put on myself and release the immense
      build up of worry and anxiety in my life in favour of acceptance and
      learning to go with the flow of life.
    </p>
