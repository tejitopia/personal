    <h1>Attract Don't Chase</h1>

    <h4>Feb 8th, 2024</h4>

    <p>
      Last week Skrillex won a Grammy and
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Es1wSHREWiI"
        >during his speech</a
      >
      he said success is something you attract not chase. Which got me thinking
      about the attention economy and my own journey building a brand and
      creating content online. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Lately I’ve been having hour long discussions with my good friend
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@noahdavidperry">Noah</a>
      about how we can figure out how to get YouTube to work for us and grow
      online. 
    </p>

    <p>
      If we were to look at the market leaders you’d think you’d have to create
      the most high budget, crazy concept ideas. Mr Beast has been on dozens of
      podcasts by now and has driven the point home that retention is so
      important when it comes to growing online. Which may be true to an extent
      however this has only led to the rise of hyper cut videos that feel
      hollow.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’ve become tired and so have millions of other people with creators
      online shouting for our attention. You can’t go anywhere online without
      having someone try to sell you an ad, product or course every five
      seconds. It’s like if you’ve ever travelled to somewhere like Bali or
      Thailand and tried walking down the street only to have shop owners harass
      you demanding you visit their store. 
    </p>

    <p>
      And yes, sometimes you might take a look but eventually you just get fed
      up and start ignoring these people screaming at you for your attention.
      Since at the end of the day most of the time it’s a low quality knock off
      these people are trying to sell you.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, there are stores that exist that have created a unique experience
      for their customers. Take Supreme for example, you don’t see them outside
      their store begging for you to check out what they’re doing. What they’ve
      done on the other hand is created a place of discovery. 
    </p>

    <p>
      What it comes down to I believe is the fact that neediness repels and
      abundance attracts. The same applies to relationships. When you’re secure
      in who you are and what you do you are okay with letting people go if they
      don’t align with you. Whereas if you’re begging someone to be in a
      relationship with you it’s quite obvious that the other person is going to
      run the other direction. 
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m hopping across examples here on purpose to demonstrate the universal
      idea of attracting success instead of chasing it. In the second half of
      Skrillex’s Grammy acceptance speech he mentioned that he wasn’t trying to
      make a hit, but simply make music he and his friends loved.
    </p>

    <p>
      Which brings me to the importance of authenticity. People online aren’t
      stupid, we’ve all been watching content endlessly everyday for many years
      now which has made our internal bullshit meters quite good. We
      instinctively know when someone is coming off as being inauthentic. 
    </p>

    <p>
      One of my biggest inspirations is
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@casey">Casey Neistat</a> who will
      literally go and make a video on anything from
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYCODMuoHNI"
        >climbing a mountain</a
      >, to
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRe9DBosLD4"
        >running a marathon</a
      >
      to
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvkgmyfMPks"
        >testing out the Apple Vision Pro</a
      >. These are all things authentic to him and he’s not trying to be anyone
      he isn’t.
    </p>

    <p>
      By doing what you enjoy and ignoring trends you are able to carve your own
      lane. I plan on taking this hypothesis into 2024 and seeing what I’m able
      to do with <a href="https://youtube.com/@tejitopia">my own content</a>. I
      don’t want to attract everyone just the right ones.
