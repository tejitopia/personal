    <h1>My Introduction to Programming</h1>

    <h4>Written by Jet Williams on Jan 8th, 2022</h4>

    <p>
      Picture this.. it’s 2011 and I’m in the backend of my tumblr site. I’m
      eleven years old and I’m trying to figure out how to install STM player so
      I can have my own custom playlist built into my blog.
    </p>

    <p>
      Tumblr is where I had my first experience playing with HTML and CSS code,
      at the time I had no idea how significant these two programming languages
      were to the Internet. You see, I was just a kid trying to get Yonkers by
      Tyler the Creator to automatically play on my blog.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now, almost five years later in 2016 I was shipped off to boarding school.
      I now had the choice of choosing two electives. I remember I picked art
      and photography but fortunately for me the photography class was full so I
      was slotted straight into the IST class with the weirdos. Our teacher
      introduced the class to Python.. well tried to at-least. You see, no one
      in that class really payed attention, or wait maybe that was just me. I
      think I was too busy binge watching Casey Neistat vlogs (this was Caseys
      golden era tbh) Regardless, I managed to learn a few things that year and
      built some super simple programs that I remember nothing from, lol.
    </p>

    <p>I dropped the subject the next year. I hated it.</p>

    <p>
      Fast-forward it’s 2021 and I’ve finally jumped into NFTs. I had known
      about the polarising phrase for a minute now and no it was actually before
      Gary Vee started jamming the phrase down peoples throats. The first NFT I
      ever owned was some NBA TopShot card worth probably nothing now. I soon
      dove deeper and deeper and began learning more and more about the
      blockchain. I learnt the difference between on-chain and off-chain data
      (s/o Anonymice! love you guys) I joined several DAOs, Started my own Axie
      Guild and now employee several scholars in the Phillipines and have met so
      many wonderful friends along the way.
    </p>

    <p>
      This blog thingy or whatever you want to call is my next step in this
      weird world of web3 and programming. I plan on using this as an outlet to
      document my learnings and hopefully encourage anyone else in a similar
      position to myself to jump into this world.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m still new to this whole programming thing but my main focuses will be:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Solidity</li>
      <li>HTML</li>
      <li>CSS</li>
      <li>Js</li>
      <li>Python</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      I do plan on learning C#, Java and PHP but for now these are my main
      priorities. One goal I wish to have completed before the conclusion of
      2022 is to release my own on-chain NFT project to accompany
      7265646163746564

    <p>
      I’m so excited to be here, I can’t wait to build some cool shit and even
      better make some even cooler friends.
    </p>

    <p>Love,</p>

    <p>Jet</p>

      get the sentiment)
