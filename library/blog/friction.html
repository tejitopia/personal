    <h1>The Fun is in The Friction</h1>

    <h4>July 2nd, 2024</h4>

    <p>
      We’ve lost the art of patience and discovery. If we can’t have it now, we
      don’t want it and since delivery times are shrinking and algorithms are
      telling us who to follow, most of us never dare to venture beyond what’s
      recommended. 
    </p>

    <p>
      It's become too easy to just follow the path of least resistance. We've
      become confined by our comfort and forgotten how to hunt. 
    </p>

    <h2>The Lost Art of Patience</h2>

    <p>
      There’s a magic in sifting through a thrift store. You never know what
      you’re going to find and although you'll probably leave the store empty
      handed. If you do manage to find that one item, it makes the entire wait
      worth it.
    </p>

    <p>
      People used to wait outside of video game stores til midnight for the
      latest Call of Duty release. Whereas today's gamers get the latest
      releases delivered to their consoles while they sleep. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Most movies today are released direct to streaming. People don't bother
      going to the cinemas anymore because it's easier to just stream the movie
      from home.
    </p>

    <p>
      There's an endless amount of examples I could give you to demonstrate that
      although things have become easier for the consumer, things have also
      become less interesting.
    </p>

    <h2>The Devaluing of The Physical</h2>

    <p>
      We've devalued physical objects and experiences, in favour of a digital
      existence. No longer do we get to experience things in the real world. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Everything changed after COVID-19. People started working from home and
      businesses were forced to think of digital first solutions. We forgot how
      to communicate with people and we became so entwined with our devices that
      the thought of speaking with another human being in the real world now
      sends fear down our spines.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm of course generalising here and making sweeping statements on the
      state of humanity and I completely understand this isn't the case for
      everyone.
    </p>

    <p>But I am worried.</p>

    <p>
      Worried that we might lose the beauty of touch, patience and discovery.
    </p>

    <p>
      Keep in mind this is coming from a self proclaimed techno optimist and
      although I'm excited to enter an even more digital world with the rise of
      augmented and virtual reality environments. I'm worried we might be
      sacrificing a little too much of the beauty of the tangible for the
      comfort of the virtual.
