    <h1>Program or Be Programmed</h1>

    <h4>May 28th, 2024</h4>

    <p>
      Social media algorithms have made it easier than ever before to connect
      with the things you love.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, if you’re not mindful of where you direct your attention, your
      algorithm can quickly shift to degenerate mind numbing content.
    </p>

    <p>
      Where your focus goes is exactly where the algorithm will take you. Which
      means you have two options here.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Be used by the algorithm</li>
      <li>Use the algorithm to your advantage</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      Option one is the default setting. It’s simple, you open your phone and
      you spin the algorithmic roulette wheel and see what random shit pops out.
      Sometimes it’s completely okay to want to use this algorithm as an
      escapism from reality, but if we’re not mindful we can quickly slip into
      the void of media.
    </p>

    <p>
      Alternatively, option two requires slightly more effort and it’s going to
      require you to go out of your way to search for what you want. In order to
      train the algorithm to our advantage we need to first know what we like or
      what we want to learn.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      “When an algorithm is jibing with your higher mind, it’s your friend. When
      it’s luring in your Primitive Mind against your Higher Mind’s will, the
      relationship is parasitic” -Tim Urban
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      It’s a small step taking a proactive approach to seek out the information
      you’d like to consume. But it can help curate a more fulfilling social
      media experience.
    </p>

    <p>
      The key learning here is unlocking the mindfulness and awareness of your
      consumption habits and monitoring where you direct your attention.
    </p>

    <p>Where focus goes, energy flows.</p>

      I was inspired to write this post after reading a section about The
      Algorithm in
      <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/">Tim Urban's</a> book
