    <h1>What's in my bag</h1>

    <p>
      Growing up I was always fascinated with those little what's in my bag
      videos on YouTube. I thought it was so cool being able to see the items
      and objects that help make up peoples lives. Theres just something so
      satisfying about knolling (s/o Tom Sachs for introducing me to the term)
    </p>

    <p>
      Anyways, I'm headed to New York in a few days so what better time than now
      to write up my own little what's in my bag post.
    </p>

    <p>So here goes..</p>

    <h2>Backpack</h2>
    <p>
      I've been using the same Patagonia 32L blackhole backpack on all my
      adventures over the past few years and its held up great! especially
      considering the amount of abuse I have put mine through, lol. If ever you
      see me IRL with the bag you will probably notice I'm normally hanging a
      Nalgene water-bottle from a carabiner because I get thirsty, like REALLY
      THIRSTY. Anyway the bag is A+, expect nothing less from Patagonia tbh, one
      of my favourite brands.
    </p>

    <h2>Shoes</h2>
    <p>
      Fun fact about me - I hate shoes. You see, I'd prefer to wonder the earth
      bare foot but there are occasions when some protection is needed. Normally
      my shoe of choice is the all-black Birkenstock Eva (They tend to not stink
      like normal Birks because they're actually made of plastic which means
      they can get wet.) Some days I even opt for the triple-black Croc, but as
      of now I'm rocking the Teva sandals - I'm still only about a week into
      breaking them in but they have held up well and just well may become my
      daily driver.
    </p>

    <h2>iPad Pro</h2>
    <p>
      The iPad Pro is one of the newer additions to my collection of essentials
      - I mostly just use it for Pro Create and YouTube. I've had iPads before
      but not until now have I actually began incorporating it into my design
      process and workflow - The Apple Pencil is undefeated. One benefit of
      taking a more digital approach to my process is the fact that I now don't
      waste stacks of A4 pages sketching out the same logo 100 times.
    </p>

    <h2>Macbook Pro</h2>
    <p>
      My laptop is quite barebones as I really only use it for a few essential
      applications. Right now I predominately just use Ledger live to sign
      transactions and trade crypto - I also use it a-lot for writing and
      editing videos, but the keyboard sucks. I think I might pickup the new 14
      inch model with the M1 chip solely because they brought back the OG
      keyboard and removed that shitty touch-bar.
    </p>

    <h2>Cameras</h2>
    <p>
      For well over a decade now I've been an avid photographer and filmmaker.
      Over the years I've refined my gear and realised I hate bulky SLR setups -
      All my video work now is literally shot all on my iPhone and GoPro. I have
      come to care less about quality and more about accessibility. I've always
      believed the best camera is the one you have on you and if your
      discouraged to shoot because it's a hassle to unload your kit - you
      probably need to rethink your setup.
    </p>

    <p>
      My holy grail of cameras is the Contax T2 - I had always wanted one and
      managed to scoop mine up on eBay for quite a reasonable price back in
      2017. The 2.8 lens on this camera is superb and it's unlike anything I've
      shot on before - All the photos just seem to turn out magical. I have
      large archive of images taken on the camera I will probably begin to share
      with the world when the time is right.
    </p>

    <h2>Books</h2>
    <p>
      I love to read and it's become a huge part of my lifestyle. I'm always
      destroying my paperbacks - breaking in the spine, highlighting 90% of the
      book and scribbling in the margins, you get the jist. But not until 2021
      was the Kindle introduced into my life - I had always been opposed going
      digital when it came to my reading habits because I always told my self
      there was no way a kindle could compete with my paperbacks. I was wrong -
      I realised I could download literally 90% of the books I'd been wanting to
      read for free from Gutenberg.org, This really was a game changer because
      it even opened the doors to self published PDFs that I previously steered
      clear from. I haven't forgotten about my paperbacks though and still hop
      between both digital and physical depending on subject matter.
    </p>

    <h2>Notebook</h2>
    <p>
      My moleskin contains all my secrets and all my ideas - I even have a 1 Ξ
      reward for anyone who finds and returns my notebook. I normally just use
      it jot down or sketch any ideas when it comes to the Tejiverse. I'd like
      to say more on this subject, but I've already said too much.
    </p>

    <h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
    <p>
      Some of the other items in my bag which are essential but don't
      necessarily deserve a paragraph include:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Passport</li>
      <li>Lacie 2tb Hardrive</li>
      <li>Pens & Markers</li>
      <li>Teji Stickers</li>
      <li>Ledger Nano S</li>
      <li>Tom Ford glasses</li>
      <li>Porta 400</li>
      <li>Yubikey</li>
      <li>Wallet</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      And that covers just about everything - I hope this has given you some
      kind of peak into my world and has maybe inspired you to take a look at
      some of the items that help make up your world.
    </p>

    <p>Love,</p>

    <p>Jet Williams</p>
