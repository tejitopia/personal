    <h1>Hacker Kid</h1>

    <h4>Jan 8th, 2022</h4>

    <p>
      Today has been an eventful day to say the least. It's currently only
      9:34AM and I've already installed:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Homebrew</li>
      <li>Git</li>
      <li>Xcode</li>
      <li>Python3</li>
      <li>Pipenv</li>
      <li>Pycharm</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Figuring out how to run lines of code in terminal was a breeze. Getting
      Homebrew to install took a couple goes but we got there in the end. I'm
      still unsure of what Pipenv does but a YouTuber said he prefers it over
      Virtualenv and Conda so I just followed his lead.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now.. funnily enough installing Xcode brought back some memories I almost
      completely forgot. So, back around maybe 2012-2013 I was an avid mobile
      gamer and one game I was obsessed with was actually Subway Surfers, now
      the reason I bring up Xcode is because I now remember using Xcode to hack
      into the game so I could unlock different boards, characters and score
      multipliers.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now, if we are on the subject of hacking let me talk a bit more about some
      of my early "hacking" days. You see I was always that kid with a
      jailbroken phone. I'd figured out how to encrypt my phone so well that if
      anyone tried to breach my security a picture was taken from the front
      facing camera of their little conniving face.. hehe
    </p>

    <p>
      One time when I was fourteen I was actually arrested (when I used to sneak
      into train tunnels) and had my phone seized. One of the police officers
      ended up calling my mother proclaiming 'Your kid has locks on everything,
      we tried getting a specialist in but we still couldn't get in.' Long story
      short I ended up getting that phone back along with a dozen photos of some
      crusty old police officers.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now, did anyone ever play Modern Warfare 2? Yeah, because I did and I was
      addicted. I was one of those trickshotter kids and was in a new clan every
      week. I had learnt how to download and use a cracked copy of photoshop
      from Pirate Bay and began designing logos for clans, this is also where I
      started diving into video editing. I also learnt how to install mod menus
      so I could get whatever prestige I wanted.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ha, I also remember when I was first introduced to the Action Replay card
      for the Nintendo DS. I thought it was the coolest thing being able to hack
      my Pokemon game so I could walk through walls. I don't think I actually
      ever owned a copy of my own action replay card but my Dad did get me an R4
      chip that let me install any game I wanted for free AND it helped me catch
      Shaymin!
    </p>

    <p>
      I think my Dad is actually the one who introduced me to the world of
      hacking and he didn't even know it at the time - we just couldn't afford
      to be buying all these new games.
    </p>

    <p>
      My Dad was actually quite the pirate back in the day, the man would
      literally rip hundreds of copies of movies from Limewire and burn them to
      CDs. He pirated so many movies that he received a formal Anti-Piracy
      warning from some big media conglomerate which I won't disclose.
    </p>

    <p>
      I could easily go on about my early hacking days and maybe even some of
      the stories from the back end of my adolescents where I discovered the
      world of social engineering and how I would somehow get my hands on AAA
      passes to any and every music festival with a couple magic words and
      emails. But that's enough for today's post, my Mum is about to drop off
      some lemonade and cinnamon scrolls, I gtg.

    <p>Cya,</p>
