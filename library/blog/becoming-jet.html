    <h1>Becoming Jet</h1>

    <h4>Oct 24th, 2024</h4>

    <h2>I'm rebranding! Here's why</h2>

    <p>
      Growing up I’ve always struggled with my identity. I’ve chopped and
      changed through hundreds of different usernames and alter egos since my
      first day on the internet. If you met or found me in the past four years
      you probably knew me as TEJI.
    </p>

    <p>
      TEJI had become my online identity I formed for myself as I entered into
      the Crypto and NFT space. I created a character which most of you have
      probably seen by now to go with my new pseudonym.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was supposed to be a blue alien but most people thought it had been a
      bear. At the time I chose the alien because that’s how I felt in the
      world, like an outsider. I felt like I didn’t fit in and was always on the
      cusp of two different worlds.
    </p>

    <p>
      For those who don’t know I’m an Aboriginal Australian with fair skin and
      red hair. Which meant I was often met with ignorant statements like
    </p>

    <p>“How could you be a real aboriginal your not black?.”</p>

    <p>
      Statements like this not only from friends but also the aboriginal
      community made me feel unsure of who I was. All I wanted to do was fit in
      and be normal like everyone else at school. I used to hate my name when I
      was younger and would often come home from school crying to my mum wishing
      that she’d given me a normal name. It wasn’t until decades later that I
      started to love my name and who I am.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m forever grateful for the TEJI arc and pseudonym that allowed me to
      experiment with all kinds of mediums and make hundreds of new friends on
      the internet. Over the four years as TEJI I made toys, clothes, music and
      even video games.
    </p>

    <p>
      TEJI helped me earn my first dollar on the internet as an artist and it
      helped build my confidence as a creator as I slowly found more like minded
      people also pursuing the things I was interested in.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the beginning there was a comfort to sharing my work behind a
      pseudonym. None of the people I knew in the real world could judge me
      because they didn’t know it was me behind the work. I was embarrassed
      about wanting to make art and content online which was why I never shared
      anything I made under my real name or personal account.
    </p>

    <p>
      Until slowly I became more confident as I realised it had been my voice
      all along that people had begun enjoying hearing. It was me and the things
      I was interested in that they liked. It was my views on the world and how
      I interacted with it, that people started paying attention to.
    </p>

    <p>
      It wasn’t because of the colours I used or what I drew but it was because
      I was having an authentic experience that I wanted to share with the
      world. People cared because I was a real human being having real world
      experiences. Which brings me to my next reason why I’m rebranding from
      TEJI back to my real name Jet Williams.
    </p>

    <p>
      As we move into the next two or three decades we are going to begin
      interfacing with more robots and non-human intelligence. Which means
      identifying as a human online with a real face that people know and trust
      is going to become more important than ever before.
    </p>

    <p>No longer am I afraid to be Jet Williams.</p>

    <p>I’m proud.</p>

    <p>Proud of who I am, where I’m from and what I’ve done so far.</p>

    <p>I have no idea where I’m going next but I’m excited.</p>

    <p>
      This marks the end of a chapter but the continuation of something thats
      always been here with me all along.
    </p>

    <p>Myself.</p>

    <h2>So what’s changing?</h2>

    <p>
      I’m still going to continue making art and content online but from now
      onwards everything will be under Jet Williams. I will still be making
      videos, art, items and whatever else I imagine, but this time on even more
      of a personal level.
    </p>

    <p>
      All of my social media accounts will change from @tejitopia →
      @jetlrwilliams
    </p>

    <p>My weekly newsletter will change from TEJI TUESDAYS → JETS JOURNAL</p>

    <p>My personal website will change from teji.io → jetlrwilliams.com</p>

    <h2>One more thing</h2>

    <p>
      One of the final reasons why I wanted to pivot from TEJI to Jet Williams
      is because I felt like if TEJI were to still exist it would be able to go
      further as it’s own entity and brand that existed beyond myself.
    </p>

    <p>
      This doesn’t mean TEJI will be gone forever. I’m just putting a pause on
      his journey and hopefully bringing him back out at a later date as it’s
      own thing.
    </p>

    <p>
      To everyone who has supported me up until now, your support means the
      world and I have no plans on quitting this journey I’ve embarked on. I’m
      just taking a moment to look up ahead and pivot accordingly so I can be
      best prepared for whats to come.
    </p>

    <p>Love,</p>

    <p>Jet Williams</p>
