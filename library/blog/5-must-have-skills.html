    <h1>5 Must Have Skills in The Age of AI</h1>

    <h4>July 24th, 2024</h4>

    <p>
      Right now you can feel the collective angst in the air as millions of
      workers are fired as more and more robots begin to enter the picture.
      Everything is changing so rapidly as the world begins to take it’s next
      form. People are unsure of where to focus their attention and are fearful
      of sinking thousands of hours into a skill that might very well become
      redundant with the next ChatGPT update.  
    </p>

    <h2>The answer?</h2>

    <p>
      The only way to prepare for a world living alongside artificial
      intelligence is to develop a set of timeless skills that will forever be
      important as long as human beings exist on this planet.
    </p>

    <h2>What are these skills?</h2>

    <h3>1. Empathy</h3>

    <p>
      We need to be able to relate to and understand one another as human
      beings. We must have an ability to cultivate a visceral understanding of
      other peoples view points and opinions. This doesn’t mean you have to
      agree with everyone you come across, but it does mean you need to be able
      to think deeply about circumstances and experiences that might’ve formed
      someones worldview. It isn’t until we’ve done this before we can have open
      and honest discussions as two people looking at two sides of the same
      coin.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Critical Thinking</h3>

    <p>
      You need to learn how to think and form your own opinions. This might
      sound silly but most of our opinions have been formed from things we may
      have just heard loosely on a podcast, a tweet or even a tiktok that we
      have now accepted as truth. We have closed our minds to the possibility
      that we might be missing a piece of crucial information that might
      actually change our stance on any one person or situation.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Curiosity</h3>

    <p>
      We need to ask more questions and feed our curiosity as much as possible.
      For now the machines answer the questions and execute on the problems.
      Whereas we’re the ones who have to dictate to these machines what we want
      them to do. Which means we must learn how to ask the right questions. To
      cultivate the curious mind you must think deeply and have an interest in
      how and why things work the way they do. The sooner we begin to dive into
      deeper levels of understanding across different areas of life, the sooner
      we will soon be able to make the previously unseen connections that will
      drive true innovation.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Interpersonal Communication</h3>

    <p>
      Understanding how to actively listen and communicate yourself is one of
      the most important skills to foster. We need to be able to convey
      ourselves through speech, body language and text. It is our social skills
      that will unlock the deeper levels of connection with one another. If we
      are too afraid to speak we will never be heard.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Adaptability</h3>

    <p>
      Over the next thirty years you might work hundreds of different jobs. You
      could be a mechanic today and a blacksmith in the metaverse tomorrow, you
      literally never know. We may also reach a point of so much abundance where
      humans never need to work again. In either scenario how would you cope
      with either outcome? How would you get through your days and find meaning
      in what you do? If we are not agile and able to adapt to the ever changing
      landscape we will unfortunately be left behind.
    </p>

    <h2>Preparing yourself</h2>

    <p>
      As Heraclitus once said “the only constant in life is change” and there’s
      a whole lot more of it coming over the next few decades. So don’t be
      afraid, accept it and learn to shape and use it to our advantage.
    </p>

    <p>Good luck.</p>
