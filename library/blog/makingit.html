    <h1>How To Make It</h1>

    <h4>May 9th, 2024</h4>

    <p>
      We all want to make it. We all have dreams, ambitions and things we want
      to bring into our lives.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’ve personally always wanted to be able to make a living off my art and
      creativity. I used to imagine a far off place into the future where I’ve
      so called made it.  
    </p>

    <p>
      But that day felt like it was always around the corner and never in my
      reach.
    </p>

    <p>
      Until recently, I didn’t realise waking up and getting another shot at
      life was the true definition of making it.
    </p>

    <p>
      It’s ironic that in this endless fight of trying to make it we realise
      we’ve already made it. We’re alive and we get another chance to continue
      making it.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you want to be a designer, artist, musician, business tycoon,
      hairdresser, dj or literally anything in the world. You have to embody the
      lifestyle you want to live. You have to be that thing from today. Don’t
      delay your dreams because you think you’re not ready. Embody who you want
      to become right now. Be the thing.
    </p>

    <p>Making it is a lifestyle that applies to any area of your life.</p>

    <p>
      If you want to be in a loving relationship. You need to first be able to
      have a loving relationship with yourself. It all starts within.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you want to attract more wealth and abundance into your life you need
      to learn how to take care of the money you already have. How do you expect
      to deal with the increased pressures of having more money if you can’t
      even deal with what you already have.
    </p>

    <p>
      Learn to take care of your own garden and plant the seeds of the future
      today. Accept that things take time to grow and be patient with yourself.
      As long as you keep consistently watering the areas of your life you’d
      like to grow, you’ll be alright.
    </p>

    <p>
      Bamboo seeds that have been planted take five years to sprout. The first
      four years show seemingly no progress. Until the fifth year when in the
      span of twelve weeks the bamboo tree grows to a height of 80-90ft.
    </p>

    <p>
      If at any moment you quit watering the bamboo in those first four years
      because you’re not seeing any growth the seed will die and there will be
      no bamboo tree.
    </p>

    <p>
      If right now you’re the seed, accept the time, dedication and patience it
      takes for what you want to achieve in your life.
    </p>

    <p>
      If by the grace of god and sheer luck that you’ve been born into this
      moment of time and are reading this, I have good news for you.
    </p>

    <p><strong>You’ve already made it, now keep making it.</strong></p>
