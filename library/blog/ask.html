    <h1>Just Ask</h1>

    <h4>May 24th, 2024</h4>

    <p>
      You’ll never know unless you just ask. It’s scary opening yourself up to
      failure but it’s the only way. 
    </p>

    <p>
      This applies to anything in life that you want. Whether that’s a
      relationship or business opportunity - 90% of the time it’s going to
      require you to take initiative to act on your wishes. 
    </p>

    <p>
      There’s a great clip of Steve Jobs somewhere on the internet explaining
      that “most people don’t get those experiences because they never ask”.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the same clip Jobs goes on to explain that “he’s never found anybody
      that didn’t want to help me if I asked them for help” 
    </p>

    <p>
      Which is so true. I’ve also never not found someone willing to help out
      and while sometimes you get rejected in the process, there’s always at
      least a few people who are willing to help. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Trying to start a podcast and need guests to come on your show? Just ask.
    </p>

    <p>
      Trying to land new clients for your new digital marketing agency? Just
      ask. 
    </p>

    <p>
      You want to hitchhike across America out of the kindness of strangers
      hearts? Just ask. 
    </p>

    <p>
      You’re trying to trade a sticker at a sneaker convention for a YouTube
      video you’re trying to film? Just ask. 
    </p>

    <p>
      If you couldn’t already tell all of the above come from a small set of
      personal experiences in my life. These little moments have confirmed to me
      that accepting rejection in life is one of the most powerful things you
      can do. The moment you realise the worse that can happen is that someone
      says no, is the moment you allow yourself to shamelessly pursue the things
      you want out of life. 
    </p>

    <p>Just ask.</p>
