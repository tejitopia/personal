    <h1>The Art of Getting Back Up</h1>

    <h4>May 13th, 2024</h4>

    <p>
      Life is made up of a series of long term games that we choose to play. Our
      jobs, our relationships, our exercise routines--are all choices that
      dictate how our lives unfold. It's easy to feel inspired and take action
      once, but it’s much harder to do it consistently. That’s why I choose to
      play games that are sustainable.
    </p>

    <p>
      My goal is to stay consistent in every area of my life for as long as
      possible, as I believe this leads to the greatest chance of growth.
    </p>

    <p>
      To illustrate this, let's consider two creators starting out trying to
      grow a brand online.
    </p>

    <p>
      Person A is a perfectionist, only sharing their work when they are
      completely satisfied. It takes them three months to produce their first
      video, expecting it to perform phenomenally due to the time and effort
      invested. If the video succeeds, Person A is motivated to create more.
      However, if it fails, the frustration of seeing no results despite the
      effort can be discouraging.
    </p>

    <p>
      In contrast, Person B embraces imperfection, focusing on iteration and
      repetition. Their output is frequent, although sometimes messy. In their
      first year, they produce 10 times more content than Person A.
    </p>

    <p>
      Who do you think becomes a better storyteller? Person A, who creates three
      works a year, or Person B, who conducts 300 experiments a year?
    </p>

    <p>
      Results may vary, but I would rather follow Person B's strategy. By not
      quitting, I see success as an inevitable by product of building resilience
      to failure through small experiments and making incremental improvements.
    </p>

    <p>
      By lowering the bar, we can play more consistently over a longer period,
      avoiding high expectations that lead to discouragement and giving up when
      unmet.
    </p>
