    <h1>When was the last time you smiled at a stranger?</h1>

    <h4>Written by Jet Williams on Dec 10th, 2023</h4>

      For the past month I’ve been travelling around Africa. You probably
      already know but I am clearly not African. I’m usually an outsider in
      these places I travel to which means I tend to stick out. I’m often met
      with weird looks from the locals. Especially when I’m walking around with
      a camera recording a vlog. That is until I decide to smile and wave back
      at whoever is staring at me. Nearly 90% of the time they will wave and
      smile back.

        language to give someone a smile.</strong

      The world is your mirror and whatever you put out there you will get back.
      If you’re walking around everyday with your headphones in closed off from
      the world - that is exactly what you will experience - a barrier between
      you and the world around you.

      I used to wear my AirPods every day to shut myself off from the outside
      world. It would signal to everyone “please don’t talk to me, I’m busy
      listening to music and you’re not worth my time.” It wasn’t until I lost
      my AirPods multiple times where I just decided to start striking up a
      conversation with shopkeepers and strangers on the street. Not only will
      this help your communication skills but it will also make that persons day
      who you’re chatting with that little bit better.

      I know how I used to feel when I’d be working behind the bar late into the
      night bored out of my mind. Until someone would come in, smile at me and
      strike up a conversation. We could be talking about literally anything and
      it would make my night that much more enjoyable.
    </p>

      I challenge whoever is reading this to consciously make a decision to
      smile at a stranger the next time you’re in public. It will make your day
      and the strangers day just that little bit better. Plus, it will signal to
      the world that you’re open to experiencing all the amazing things it has
      to offer.
