    <h1>Stop Trying To Be Perfect</h1>

    <h4>Written by Jet Williams on April 27th, 2024</h4>

    <p>
      I believe we as human beings are perfectly imperfect. It’s our flaws and
      imperfections that truely make us special.
    </p>

    <p>
      In a world that’s becoming more formulated by the day with the rise of
      artificial intelligence and automation the need for human made is going
      dramatically increase. 
    </p>

    <p>
      People will soon become tired of interfacing with robots, algorithmic
      content, and cookie cutter products and begin to yearn once again for
      human connection.
    </p>

    <p>
      Human beauty is found within the cracks. Each of our flaws is exactly what
      makes us unique in a world soon to be filled of artificial copies. 
    </p>

    <p>
      What makes human life special will never be able to be replicated by
      machine. There is a magic within all of us we will never be able to truely
      grasp and that’s exactly what makes life special. 
    </p>

    <p>
      It’s the infinite search for the answer we will never quite grasp. It’s
      the chase, the journey and everything in between life and death that gives
      us meaning. 
    </p>

    <p>
      This is why I love so called shitty art. Because it’s genuine. It’s real
      and It’s flawed. The shaky lines, the blurry footage, the poor editing. It
      all creates character within a work. 
    </p>

    <p>
      While it’s good to aim for perfection with everything you do. I truely
      believe we should be chasing iteration over perfection if we really want
      to make progression as humans.
    </p>

    <p>
      To whoever reading this I urge you to lean into your quirks and to follow
      the things that others might think is weird.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>In a world where anyone can be anyone, choose to be you.</strong>
    </p>
