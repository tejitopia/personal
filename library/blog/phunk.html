    <h1>Why I purchased a “Fake” CryptoPunk for $4000</h1>

    <h4>Written by Jet Williams on Jan 16th, 2022</h4>

    <h2>The War Begins</h2>

    <p>
      Let me set the tone — It’s 2009 and I’ve just wrapped up editing my first
      ever YouTube video on Windows Movie Maker. I was so excited to share my
      creation with the world until I was struck with my first ever DMCA notice.
      My video had been taken down from YouTube and nine-year-old me was
      introduced to copyright laws for the first time.
    </p>

    <p>
      Look, to be fair what I created was no more than a slideshow that played
      over the top of War by Sean Kingston — But nevertheless I was proud of
      what I’d created, it was a display of an early act of creativity from a
      kid who just wanted to make something for the fun of it — This kid wasn’t
      trying to make money or drive sales away from Sean Kingston, he was just
      trying to express himself.
    </p>

    <h2>My SoundCloud account is deleted</h2>

    <p>
      The year is 2016 and I’ve started gaining attention on my SoundCloud
      account — I’d been posting Nightcore remixes of popular songs, which in
      layman’s terms basically means I sped up the song in Virtual DJ and
      re-uploaded it under my name.
    </p>

    <p>
      My first remix to “blow-up” in my eyes was my sped up version of Say It by
      Flume — The song garnered over 20,000 streams (WOAH SO MANY PLAYS! lol)
      and pushed me to try produce more of my dodgy DIY remixes in hopes of
      getting that next dopamine hit of having a song blow up. This pursuit for
      plays didn’t end well, my account ended up getting deleted because I
      received one too many strikes for abusing SoundClouds copyright rules. I
      really do miss that account and feel a deep sense of sorrow inside me when
      I reminisce on all the playlists and music I’ve lost.
    </p>

    <h2>Buying my first CryptoPhunk</h2>

    <p>
      I just paid Ξ1.248 (or around $4129.13 USD at the time of writing this
      post) for a CryptoPunk derivative called a CryptoPhunk. Now why would I do
      this? Stylistically, the only difference between a Punk and Phunk is the
      that fact that Phunks have been flipped to face the left side and thats
      about it, lol.
    </p>

    <p>
      So you’re telling me you just spent $4000 for a bootleg NFT that the
      creators literally just flipped?
    </p>

    <p>
      Uh.. Yes, that’s correct sir, but it actually goes much deeper than this,
      let me explain.
    </p>

    <h2>Punks vs Phunks</h2>

    <p>
      CryptoPunks were first created in 2017 by developers Matt Hall and John
      Watkinson — two avid crypto fanatics who believe that the blockchain
      “provides a layer of trust that removes the need for lawyers and
      middlemen.” Punks were first released to the public as a free claim and
      for months thousands of Punks sat unclaimed on the official Larva Labs
      website — Now we all know what happened to the value of these OG
      CryptoPunks right?
    </p>

    <p>
      Well, not long after the demand began to skyrocket in 2021 for the
      pixelated avatars a twitter user by the name of @Philiptheintern would
      launch his derivative project called CryptoPhunks — Not long after both
      Matt and John would take legal action and pursue the team behind
      CryptoPhunks (I hope your starting to see how much this contradicts Larva
      Labs so called beliefs in a true open and decentralised web..)
    </p>

    <p>
      Phunks would soon then be delisted from OpenSea after becoming the first
      project to receive a DMCA takedown from Larva Labs. The developers behind
      CryptoPhunks would soon abandon the project, unwilling to counter the
      DMCA. The founders actually wrote a letter declaring their withdrawal from
      the project which can be found here.
    </p>

    <p>But this was only the beginning you see..</p>

    <p>
      Shortly after the CryptoPhunks team resigned a group of OG Phunks holders
      would emerge from the ashes and build their own royalty free marketplace
      called NotLarvaLabs. The marketplace has now done over $50m+ in total
      volume and has a top sale of 100Ξ ($300K+) for an individual Phunk.
    </p>

    <h2>Why I purchased my Phunk</h2>

    <p>
      You see, I and many others have been fighting centralisation for years now
      whether we’ve known it or not. You probably didn’t know that Ethereum was
      first conceived because its founder Vitalik Buterin had his character
      nerfed in World of Warcraft — Which is what made him realise “what horrors
      centralised services can bring.”
    </p>

    <p>
      To me, my Phunk purchase is less of an investment and more of a statement
      — It encapsulates the transitionary period we find ourselves in between
      Web2 and Web3. The Phunk is everything Web3 prides itself on and I believe
      is ironically even more Punk than the original Punks. The Phunk is a big
      Fuck You to centralisation and I love it — Not to mention it but my Phunk
      is actually a Pirate which seems quite fitting.
    </p>

    <h2>Here's our chance!</h2>

    <p>
      Not until recently have open-source and CC0 projects been a viable option
      for creators and builders online. Pioneers in the space like NotLarvaLabs,
      NounsDAO, CrypToadz, Github etc. are all beginning to pave the way for the
      open and decentralised web that Satoshi Nakamoto originally envisioned in
      2009 and I can’t wait.
    </p>

    <p>Be Phree my Phreinds,</p>

    <p>Love Teji</p>
