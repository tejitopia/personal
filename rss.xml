      <h1>The Information Diet</h1>

    <p>
      Thoughts on mindful consumption online written by Jet Williams on Jan
      15th, 2024
    </p>

    <p>
      Over the past decade our attention spans have been shattered and we can no
      longer focus on anything for more than five minutes, before getting bored
      and moving on to the next thing. The introduction of short form content
      over the past decade has only compounded the effects mass consumption of
      media has had on our attention spans
    </p>

    <p>
      A decade from now I believe we will look back on this era of Internet
      consumption the same way we look back on our grand parents who thought
      smoking was harmless. In hindsight it's going to be obvious — anything in
      excess is going to have harmful effects in some way on us.
    </p>

    <p>
      Which is why I believe we should become more mindful of our consumption
      online. One way to do this is to introduce an information diet into our
      online routines. Much like a traditional diet we need to limit the amount
      of junk we consume and make a conscious effort to eat foods rich in
      nutrition.
    </p>

    <p>
      We can start this process by simply pruning what we don't need online.
      This can be done by first unfollowing all of the accounts you really don't
      care about. This should reduce your feed to those that truely matter in
      your lives.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, there's an issue with this because todays algorithms focus less
      on your network of friends and accounts you follow and more on content the
      algorithm thinks you might like. So even if you followed five people you
      will still have an endless amount of content you can scroll through.
    </p>

    <p>
      One solution to this is building your own highly curated feed of content
      using an old technology called RSS, which stands for really simple
      syndication. There are hundreds of videos and tutorials online explaining
      how to setup your own RSS feed using one of the many RSS readers you can
      download on your device.
    </p>

    <p>
      In short, the way RSS works is you copy the RSS feed link from any source
      of content you find interesting and plug it into your RSS reader which
      will continually check if any of your feeds have added new content.
    </p>

    <p>
      Keep in mind, I'm not advocating to cut the algorithm completely out of
      our lives. It's a fantastic tool that can be used as a place of discovery.
      However, if we are not careful we can quickly become a slave to them. Your
      attention is a muscle that should be trained and it's something I
      personally want to improve in my life.
    </p>

    <p>
      I've found that reading long form articles and books from credible sources
      who aren't trying to play into the algorithm can often be a fantastic way
      to improve your focus. I'd recommend a set of people for you to read but
      what we deem useful is often relative to the individual. You could also
      physically limit access to your devices by placing them in different
      rooms, if you really want to complete a certain task and need a
      distraction free environment.
    </p>

    <p>
      In summary, It's not necessarily about what you consume but it's about
      becoming more mindful of our consumption patterns. The answer is often the
      one you don't want to hear and it's the fact that to improve focus we need
      to do hard things. So the next time you think about picking up a your
      phone to scroll on TikTok how about you try read a chapter or two of that
      book you've been meaning to read.

  <title>Letting Go</title>

    <h1>Letting Go</h1>

    <p>Thoughts on letting go written by Jet Williams on Jan 11th, 2024</p>

    <p>
      The Universe is a funny place. It often feels like everything you want you
      can’t have. It’s this desperation and neediness for things to work out
      that often repels the desired outcome far away from you.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’ve experienced this first hand in my life when it comes to becoming a
      full time creator. I dropped everything to focus on my passion and build
      things online. Yet when the neediness for things to work came in as
      financial pressures began to grow — I started catering my ideas to the
      algorithm and what I should make instead of what I wanted to make.
    </p>

    <p>
      It’s the age old conundrum where the musician who started off making songs
      in their bedroom signs a record deal and is now expected to start putting
      out an album each and every year. As time goes on they lose motivation as
      the label pushes for certain kinds of songs to be made over the
      experimental works that got them to where they are in the first place.
    </p>

    <p>
      In some ways it feels like we are abusing our creativity when we look to
      profit from it. I'm in no way saying you’re not allowed to make money from
      your art — but I am thinking we may need to become more mindful of how we
      treat our creativity.
    </p>

    <p>
      Perhaps instead of needing our creativity to work we just let go and allow
      it to work. It’s something I’ve been working on that has been extremely
      hard for myself. I’ve decided go against all advice from the online gurus
      who tell you to ‘burn the boats’ and ‘go all in’ if you want it to work in
      favour of now going out and looking for a job that will provide enough
      stability to reduce the amount of pressure I’m putting on my creativity.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m a strong believer in the <strong>law of detachment</strong> which is a
      belief that
      <strong
        >you can have anything you want as long as you don't need it</strong
      >. I’ve found this principle to apply to all areas of life —
      <strong>neediness repels and abundance attracts</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Today I let go of all pressures I’ve put on myself and release the immense
      build up of worry and anxiety in my life in favour of acceptance and
      learning to go with the flow of life.
    </p>

         <h1>Productivity</h1>

    <p>Thoughts on productivity written by Jet Williams on Jan 11th, 2024</p>

    <p>
      I wrote this list as a basic framework to help increase the productivity
      in my life. These principles are merely guidelines and the opposite of
      each idea is almost also true in some cases.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Eat the frog first</li>
      <li>Accept that everything is a work in progress</li>
      <li>Get going then get good</li>
      <li>Brick by brick</li>
      <li>Laugh at perfection</li>
      <li>Finished work creates more finished work</li>
      <li>Fail more but learn from your mistakes</li>
      <li>Write to organise your thoughts and ideas</li>
      <li>Allocate time dedicated to thinking about ideas</li>
      <li>Write lots of lists</li>
      <li>If you get an idea write it down immediately</li>
      <li>Start what you finish but also know when to quit</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Some ideas in my list that have been adapted from this

         <h1>We Need Each Other</h1>

    <p>Written by Jet Williams on Jan 10th, 2024</p>

    <p>
      The iPhone may be designed in California but it's the perfect example of
      what we can build when we work together. It may be hard to see the
      interconnectedness of all things until you look under the screen and
      realise that all the raw materials and components that make up the iPhone
      come from all over the planet — There's chips being made in Taiwan that
      are then shipped to Japan for assembly, while there's also miners in Chile
      digging for the copper that's used to create the wires that line your
      phone.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can break down the chain of assembly of literally anything — ideas,
      shoes, novels, songs and even YOU can be broken down into a long line of
      inputs. Something I've said for years is '<i
        >everything is a remix of a remix</i
      >' and I believe we should become more aware of how influenced we are from
      the world around us. All of your ideas and opinions are a mashup of the
      inputs you've received over your lifetime.
    </p>

    <p>
      My own personal taste in clothes, music, movies etc. all comes from my
      experience growing up and being surrounded by both my mother and fathers
      interests. I probably wouldn't be designing clothes if I didn't have to
      help my Mum take photos of her own clothes for her eBay store. Perhaps, I
      also wouldn't be off on crazy adventures around the world if I didn't grow
      up playing my Dad's favourite video game Tomb Raider.
    </p>

    <p>
      There's a
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcWqzZ3I2cY">great interview</a>
      between Lex Fridman and Jeff Bezos where Bezos goes into detail explaining
      how he would've never been able to build Amazon if it weren't for
      pre-existing infrastructure. Without things like credit cards and the
      postal service Amazon would've never existed. He's now making it a
      priority to build the next wave of infrastructure for the next generation
      to iterate upon what he's managed to build.
    </p>

    <p>
      Everything you see in this world is apart of a universal interconnected
      web of ideas, things and people. To think it's possible to go at this
      alone is ludicrous — countries need each other, couples need each other,
      friends need each other, companies need each other,
      <strong>we need each other.</strong>

      <h1>Sunsets and Rainbows</h1>

    <p>Written by Jet Williams on Jan 9th, 2024</p>

    <p>
      Yesterday, I saw a full rainbow and it was a good reminder of how beauty
      often appears after the storm clears. For the past six months I’ve been
      dealing with one of the biggest personal challenges I’ve faced in my life
      yet. However, I’m a huge believer in reframing any circumstance you find
      yourself in.
    </p>

    <p>
      I used to be an avid photographer and one of the key understandings I
      learnt during my time taking thousands of photos is — If you ever wanted
      to get good lighting or a beautiful sunset you had to have the right
      weather conditions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now what are the right weather conditions? If it’s a clear day without a
      cloud in the sky you’ll often get a mediocre sunset. Sure it will look
      alright but it’s not going to be one of those sunsets everyone on your
      Instagram posts a story of.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you want a real sunset - you’re going to need some rain and clouds. It
      sounds counter intuitive wishing for poor weather when you want to catch a
      beautiful sunset, but it’s the only way to produce an exceptional result.
    </p>

    <p>
      Back in the day my friend
      <a href="https://instagram.com/moistmark">Mark</a>, another talented
      photographer and I would often drive for multiple hours through wet
      weather in hopes of catching the ever elusive magical sunset. Most of the
      time our journeys would lead to nothing but for a small fraction of our
      trips the conditions would line up perfectly and we’d spend the entire
      evening chasing the light.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you want a mediocre sunset (or life that is) wish for clear skies.
      However, if you want to live an exceptional life full of vibrant colors —
      you need to be okay with a few rainy days. A key takeaway here is
      understanding that not every rainy day is going to lead to a magnificent
      sunset and you need to be okay with that. However, a day may come when
      things are looking their worst and you are soaking wet until suddenly you
      look up.
    </p>

  <title>Dealing With Writers Block</title>

     <h1>Dealing With Writers Block</h1>

    <p>Written by Jet Williams on Apr 3rd, 2023</p>

    <hr />

    <p>
      Being an artist requires both input and output. I’ve always said
      everything is a remix of a remix - from the music you listen to, the house
      you live in and the clothes you wear everything is an iteration of
      something pre-existing. Even me and you are iterations of our ancestors.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now the reason why I bring this up is because lately I’ve been feeling
      unproductive, I feel like I haven’t been outputting as much work as I’d
      like to. However I write this not only as a reminder to myself but to the
      artists at home beating themselves up because they feel like they’ve lost
      their momentum.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong
        >EVERYTHING IS OKAY, THIS IS PART OF THE PROCESS. DO NOT STRESS, DO NOT
        WORRY, BUT INSTEAD MAKE THE MOST OF THIS TIME.</strong
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      From my experience creativity comes in waves, one minute you're
      overflowing with creativity and then suddenly you feel lost and unsure of
      where to take your next step. It’s easy to lose that momentum but It’s
      also a great time to reassess and take a moment to understand what you’re
      really trying to do with your work.
    </p>

    <p>When faced with artists block you have two options:</p>

    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>TAKE ACTION:</strong> Persevere through the discomfort. You're probably going to be
              unhappy with your work as you're piecing something together. But this is
              likely because you've become too outcome-oriented and are worrying too
              much about the finished product. If you decide to take action, just make
              something, no matter how good or bad it is. You don’t have to even share it
              with the world, and I’d actually suggest not sharing it with anyone. This
              is to just get you back in the rhythm of finishing what you start.
            </li>
          
            <li>
                <strong>ABSORB:</strong>
              Become a sponge and go discover something new. For example, I’m typically
              an avid reader but over the past few months, I was struggling to find
              something I could really sink my teeth into. That was until I picked up my
              first volume of Manga just under a week ago. I’ve now almost completed the
              entire Chainsaw Man series in the span of a few days and have stumbled
              into a world of excitement. Browsing the aisles of the bookstore now
              sparks that wonder and excitement needed to approach any type of creative
              work.
            </li>
          </ol>
    </p>

    <p><strong>NOTE: YOU ARE NOT WASTING YOUR TIME - EVERYTHING IS CONNECTED</strong></p>

    <p>
        When I’m in the absorption phase I find it easy to feel like I’m wasting my time.
I often think to myself I could be drawing or designing something instead of looking at someone else's work. However you need to understand everything is interconnected and listening to that album you just discovered or binging a new series you've fallen in love with is only adding fuel to your creative fire pit.
    </p>

    <p>
        In this instance reading volume upon volume of Chainsaw Man isn’t just entertaining me but is giving me context to the world of Japanese storytelling. I’m unconsciously picking up on new art styles and storytelling techniques that I may or may not use down the line.
    </p>

    <p>
        The aim of the absorption phase is to merely rediscover that feeling of joy and wonder again so much so that you feel the need to try to bring that energy into your own work.
    </p>

    <p>Good luck.</p>

      <h1>Life Is A Game and How To Play It</h1>

    <p>Written by Jet Williams on Jul 8th, 2022</p>

    <hr />

    <p>
      I recently arrived home from a trip to the USA and came back feeling quite
      overwhelmed, unsure and afraid of what direction my life needed to take.
      I’d just spent just over three weeks traveling over the country attending
      blockchain conferences, music festivals and art shows — I was so inspired
      yet so intimidated by everyone I’d come across.
    </p>

    <p>
      I needed a way to unwind to keep my mind from digging myself into a
      quarter life crisis and what better way to distract yourself than playing
      video games. I used to think playing these seemingly arbitrary games was a
      complete waste of time that could be better off spent towards hours in the
      real world. However, I decided to let go of all resistance and pick up my
      Nintendo Switch that hadn’t been touched in over two years.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now.. What game do I play? There’s too many options — usually the same
      thing happens when I try to watch Netflix and end up not wanting to watch
      anything at all at the thought of choosing the wrong show. But after
      watching a few ‘Top 10 Nintendo Switch games of all time’ videos on
      YouTube a certain game with an art style reminiscent of my informative
      years playing Pokémon on the DS had happened to stand out to me. This game
      was Stardew Valley and from what I gathered the game was a cross between
      Farm Simulator and Animal Crossing.

      It was the exact world I wanted to venture into far away from this one.
      Ironically though I found myself completing the same mundane tasks as I
      would out here in the real world — I’d work, buy things, upgrade my stats,
      go on quests and get to know the NPCs. The only difference? I was enjoying
      it. There technically is no real aim to the game itself which is where I
      began drawing similarities to what it’s like in our world.

      No one really knows why we’re here and what we’re supposed to do and even
      I beat myself up at times for not having my ten-year plan figured out. But
      that’s not the point — you’re supposed to be confused on how to complete
      the next quest, you’re supposed to upgrade your character exactly how you
      want and customize your home with cool little trinkets you found on the
      other side of the map. It’s not that serious, it’s just a game. This is
      why I think it’s so easy to enjoy any of these life simulator games
      because you can see tangible progress — you know how long you have until
      you level up or get the next upgrade. You set little goals for yourself
      even if they seem silly, like saving up for a rare limited edition cactus
      painting you can hang in your house.

      I’ve begun looking at the world around me as if it were a super advanced
      video game with nearly every feature and emotion imaginable. There are an
      infinite amount of ways to play the game and there’s no such thing as the
      right way. We all spawn in different locations with different tools and
      abilities but it’s about learning to navigate the unknown. Each journey is
      relative to the player; what you find challenging might come easy to
      others and vice versa.
    </p>

    <p>
      And yes, some people use cheat codes to skip levels and upgrade their
      in-game currency but one thing that I know is that GTA got pretty boring
      when I was able to buy anything in the game. I guess this is just my
      less-corny way to spin the journey, not the destination trope in a way
      that I can relate to. Not to mention but some of my most memorable and
      most rewarding experiences in-game have been playing multiplayer with my
      friends even if that meant talking absolute garbage for hours on end. To
      keep things short, the choice is yours and even if you don’t max out your
      character don’t discount all the little things you did achieve — even the
      smallest things matter.
